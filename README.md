# README-Generator

## Description 
        
A README generator that uses inquirer and node to prompt users on their content and generate a README file with the info provided. In this project I learned more about template literals and using the inquirer module. 
        
## Usage 
        
Add the code files and folders to a program like VS code, run npm install to install dependencies, then enter npm start in the CLI and follow the prompts. Your README file will be generated and added to the Develop Folder.
